Exercise week 1:

Hi,

Sorry I am a bit late. My name is Luisa, so it is 12+1=13 and the 13 Fibonacci number is 233.

Luisa

Exercise week 2:


My surname is Timothy

The first letter T is number 84

The last letter y is number 121

Fibonacci number 205 is 3111581989804070186099320645726169127737705



ord() in Python is defined as: Given a string of length one, return an integer representing the Unicode code point of the character when the argument is a unicode object, or the value of the byte when the argument is an 8-bit string (Souce: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ord-function-python/)
