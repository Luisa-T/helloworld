# Higher Diploma course homework
# This repository contains coursework, homework, and practice for the Programming and scripting course.
1. The first homework is entitled fibl.py. This returns the Fibonacci number for a variable entered. Line 16 is the practice with my surname.
2. LuisaTimothyExercisesWeek1+2.txt is just a text file of our first two exercises.
The files CollatzLuTi.py and CollazLuTi.py are the the same but contain obviously a typo from my side. They concern the Collatz conjecture. This was a homework exercise.
3. Euler5.py attempts to solve the fifth project Euler problem.
4. Tuesday.py: I followed the steps in the lecture to write this so it is not my own work.
5. Euler3.py I attempted to resolve problem 3 of project Euler and did most of it myself.
6. fibo2Euler.py attempts to resolve the second Euler problem.
7. forloop.py was a homework assignment.
8. multipleseuler1.py is the firist project Euler probelm as discussed in one of the lectures.
9. range.py concerns the lecture for the range function and I followed the steps in the video.
10. squares.py is a homework assigment.
11. sumwhile.py is a homework assignment as well.
irisdata.csv and irisdata.py is my attempt to try and resolve the homework assignment in relation to the iris dataset. I am still working on this.
12. factorial.py is the homework assigment in relation to using the factorial function. I got some inspiration from stackoverflow in relation to this.
